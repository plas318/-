"2. based on the models.py you have created, and the best practices, create a serializers.py file and a views.py that fit with the restful backend app I'm creating using drf (django rest framework). The serializers would be based on the models.py file created. The view would use the models(serializers) and provide a restful backend. Some basic views it should include are: Loginview, logoutview, Userview (read,update,delete for the admin), profileview (read,update,delete), postview, etc.. provide the necessary views for all of the models. The views should follow the best practices and should consider the permissions such as (only the owner of the post should be able to modify posts..) and authentications such as session or token authentication. Also for some views such as posts view should have some functions, filters available such as sort, filter, search options. Some views such as posts also should have some nested data, such as nesting the corresponding comments data with the post data. I will leave how you implement each views up to you, consider the fact that the backend api should provide a restful service."
